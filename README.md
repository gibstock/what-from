# What From?

A Lightweight, simple app to get actor information from the IMDB website without all the bloat.

## The Genesis

> "Oh what's he from???"

A question that gets asked at my house ***a lot*** while we watch movies and TV. Sure, we usually Google it, but that comes with ads and sorting through other relevant data. 

So you go to IMDB.com and yes, you can find them there, but there is so much information that it's overkill. Not to mention the time it takes to load and then traverse throuh all the ads...

I just wanted something quick and dirty, to the point, where I can check a list and recognize what I know them from, and then get on from my life.

And **What From?** was born.

## Which API did I use?

What From? uses the [API](https://github.com/gibstock/whatfromAPI) that I built for searching IMDB.com for just what I need. It's not the sleekest design, I know, but it gets the job done and is easy to use.
